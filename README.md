-Debugging

When you are working with large xml,html files witch include a lot of elements,parents and subElements.
If you want for example to manipulate dom with javascript or php,it may become exhausting for your eyes to check the DOM-flow through inspect element or by reading the xml based file directly.Personally this progress made me a couple of times to loose my concetration to the flow and trying to call a className,for example, with the wrong key.This tool just save some space on your mind which you were using to remember things about DOM and makes the DOM watching much easier for your eyes.


-Presentation

If you are a project manager of a complex sql system and you need to explain the interaction between tables to your developers,make an xml and show them the generated graph from this tool.
Do the same to teach system's functionality to a new employer.

If you are a teacher in computer science use this tree-graphs to explain to your students the inheritance in programming.
